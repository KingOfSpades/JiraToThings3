# Jira To Things3

This is a project to add tasks from Jira to [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/)

Requires Yosemite because it uses JXA for ease of scripting. It is a fork of the original project [jiratotaskmanagers](https://github.com/hackerdude/) by [HackerDude](https://github.com/hackerdude)

It has the current functions:
- Sync open Jira issues to a Things3 Project by choise
- Reads DueDate of Jira issue and applys this to the toDo
- Add's all new toDo's to the Today list (schedules todo's for today)
- Supports multible query's (I have it set up to get my Tickets, Releases, Changes etc and drop them in to different lists)

Shortcommings:
- No 2 way sync
- No auto updating. Once a todo is added it wil not be updated. If a todo with a deadline has been added to Things3 for example and the dueDate changes this will not be reflected in Things3. You will need to delete the toDo, clear the trash and sync again.


## Why?

If you are a fan of David Allen's [GTD](http://gettingthingsdone.com/ "Getting Things Done"), you probably know how important it is to have only "One Inbox". Many people use something that syncs everywhere, such as Omnifocus or Things.

However for collaboration with others, many techies use [Atlassian JIRA] (https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira "Atlassian JIRA Product page"). This ends up in a weird "two inboxes" problems, that forces us to schedule our coding life separate from our non-coding life (both work and play).

This I believe leads to tremendous life imbalances. Do I code now, or do I write docs (which are not in JIRA)? On my "What's Next", are my coding tasks included?

JIRA To Task managers is a set of scripts that you can schedule on your Mac, which create one task for each of your assigned JIRA tasks. You can use cron to "set it and forget it", and get back to *One Inbox Bliss*.

## Setting Up

You may need to use [rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) to install a newer ruby. I use 2.1.5, and it's what's specified in the Gemfile.

The first time you run it, it looks like this:
```
(maybe RVM install or something..)
$ bundle install
(installs all your gems and goodies..)

$ ./jira-to-things3 -C
Cleared login from /Users/yourname/.jiratotaskmanagers/jira_to_things.yml
JIRA Url (usually https://yourdomain.atlassian.net):
    (you type your JIRA URI)
JIRA Query (leave blank to use assignee = currentUser() order by priority desc ):
    (If you don't know JQL, blank should be fine)
Project Name on your Mac's To Do App:
    (type the Project name in your Mac's TODO app)
User name:
    (your JIRA user name.
		Note: If you use OAuth, you still have a user name mapping,
		it's in your profile view)
Password:
Store config? (y/n) y
Running JQL:
assignee = currentUser() order by priority desc
Storing password
Storing on /Users/yourname/.jiratotaskmanagers/jira_to_things.yml
Got 50 issues that we'll sync with your app
```
After this, every time you run it it looks like this:
```
Running add_to_things3.jxa
Finished updating 50 tasks in Things.
$ ./jira-to-things
Running JQL:
assignee = currentUser() order by priority desc
Got 999 issues that we'll sync with your app

Running add_to_things.jxa
Finished updating 999 tasks in Things.
```
## Some Useful Queries

The default query should show everything assigned to you, open or not (we need to know when it's closed to mark it done). But sometimes this could be a lot of stuff and overwhelm you. So here's other possibilities:
```ql
assignee = currentUser() and (sprint in openSprints()) order by priority desc
```

This query will show whatever you have assigned to any current sprints. If your workflow has your issues moving naturally to the next sprint after the first one, this should work well.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't get object on (JXA file)
``
jiratotaskmanagers/lib/task_destinations/add_to_omnifocus.jxa:1676:1700: execution error: Error on line 42: Error: Can't get object. (-1728)
``

This is nearly always a problem with your project or context not existing. Use the `--print-config` option to see the configuration and make sure your project names and contexts are correct. Go to the appropriate line (42 in this case) to see which variable is wrong for a hint.

Once you've determined what was wrong, `--clear-config` option to reconfigure, and answer the questions correctly.

### JIRA::HTTPError Unauthorized

```
/Users/David/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.5/gems/jira-ruby-0.1.14/lib/jira/request_client.rb:14:in `request': Unauthorized (JIRA::HTTPError)
```

This is a JIRA authentication error. We use JIRA basic auth. Clear your config and log in correctly.

Note that if you have never signed in to JIRA using a password (for example, if you use Google Apps login), you need to go to your profile, look at the username and click on "Set Password" to set an initial password. Make sure you can log in to JIRA directly.


## Adding it to Cron

You are set up! Now you can put it on a cron line, like this one which sets it to run at office
hours (use `crontab -e` in Terminal for this):
```bash
*/10 7-18 * * * /PATH_TO_GIT/jira-to-things3 > /yourdir/log/jira_to_omnifocus.log 2>&1
```
Congratulations!  You are done.

## Multiple Profiles

Say you have two or three filters you'd like to get imported with different settings (maybe sub-projects, different contexts for different JIRAs, etc). For this you can use multiple profiles. Simply pass the `--config-file` option to set up a new yml file. For example:

```bash
$ ./jira-to-things --config-file=myopensourceproject.yml
Config: myopensourceproject.yml
JIRA Url (usually https://yourdomain.atlassian.net):
```

### Security Warning

The password for your JIRA account will be saved on a file on your computer called
`~/.jiratoomnifocus/jira_credentials.yml`. It is encrypted using blowfish using a constant key.

As long as both your credentials file are secured as (chmod 700) and owned by the user that will be running it on cron), you should be okay and secure (unless someone breaks into your account, in which case you have bigger problems than your JIRA access!).

If this bothers you, you can set the environment variable `JIRA_TO_TASKS_CRYPT_KEY` to have the configuration store use a different key. You will need to run -C to clear the config that uses the old key.
